How to Build and Run
====================

(1) at gobgp root

    go install -ldflags="-r /opt/project/gobgp_test/tools/go_srx_test" -gcflags='-N -l' ./...
    go install -ldflags="-r /opt/project/gobgp_test/tools/go_srx_test" -gcflags='-N -l' ./...
    go build -ldflags="-r /opt/project/gobgp_test/tools/go_srx_test" -gcflags='-N -l'

        where, -ldflags, -r means rpath in binary
               -gcflags, '-N -l' : gives additional debugging information in binary

               '...' ellipsis (three dots): all packages in the current directory and its subdirectories on go command

(2) at gobgpd
    build without "./..."



(3) ETC
    go build 
        -x : -x, print the commands (show all detailed compile information)
        -d : dry run, print the commands but do not run them
        -v : print the names of packages as they are compiled
